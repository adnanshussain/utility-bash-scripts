# utility-bash-scripts
A set of ***utility*** and customized ***bash scripts*** (mostly ***for a*** node js) ***developer working on Ubuntu 20.04***

## Installation
>cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/adnanshussain/utility-bash-scripts.git

then edit the .profile script in your home folder root
>sudo nano .profile

and add the following line and save and exit
`export PATH=~/utility-bash-scripts:$PATH`

then
>cd utility-bash-scripts
>chmod u+x *.sh

Logout and re-login into the terminal.

Now you can run these scripts from any folder just by typing their name and you will also get AutoCompletion help from the bash terminal ! 😁
